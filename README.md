# Finetuning Large Language Models

When you complete this course, you will be able to:

- Understand when to apply finetuning on LLMs
- Prepare your data for finetuning
- Train and evaluate an LLM on your data

With finetuning, youâ€™re able to take your own data to train the model on it, and update the weights of the neural nets in the LLM, changing the model compared to other methods like prompt engineering and Retrieval Augmented Generation. Finetuning allows the model to learn style, form, and can update the model with new knowledge to improve results.
